# VSL

**V**ectorData **S**ecurity **L**ayer is an own transport security, written entirely in C#.  
It offers public key authentication with `RSA-2048` and encrypts messages with `AES-256-CBC` and `HMAC-SHA-256`.  
Furthermore, VSL is able to transfer files asynchronously over the main connection using multiplexing.
It can end-to-end-encrypt files and provides full meta data.
